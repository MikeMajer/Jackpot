# Jackpot game 
My interpretation of well-know Jackpot game.

To start playing just enter your bid and hit **Let's Play!** button.
It will draw three randomly selected colours (red, green and blue), 
if drawn colours will be the same or each of them will be different
you double your scores else you will lose it.
